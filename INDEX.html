  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>This is my first effort to create a website.  There's still so much to learn.</p>
  <p>I decided to take this course to understand the nuts and bolts behind a website rather than just using tools such as</p>
  <p>Squarespace or Wix, etc. </p>
  <p>I tend to be someone who would rather change his own tires than go to a garage...</p>
